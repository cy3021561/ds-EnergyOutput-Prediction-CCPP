# Combined Cycle Power Plant Data Set Analysis

## Overview

This project focuses on analyzing data from a Combined Cycle Power Plant, collected over a period of six years (2006-2011). The dataset is particularly rich in ambient variables captured when the power plant operated at full load.

## Dataset Features

- **Time Frame**: 2006 - 2011
- **Operating Condition**: Full load operation
- **Features**:
  1. Temperature (T)
  2. Ambient Pressure (AP)
  3. Relative Humidity (RH)
  4. Exhaust Vacuum (V)
- **Target Variable**: Net hourly electrical energy output (EP)

## Objective

The primary goal is to utilize these features to predict the net hourly electrical energy output of the power plant.

## Data Source

- The Combined Cycle Power Plant dataset can be downloaded from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Combined+Cycle+Power+Plant).

## Importance

This analysis is significant for understanding the efficiency and operational dynamics of power plants, which is crucial for optimizing energy production and reducing operational costs.

## Analysis Approach

- Explore the relationships between ambient conditions and the power plant's energy output.
- Develop predictive models to estimate the net hourly electrical energy output based on the given ambient variables.
